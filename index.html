          <h1>WvW Tactics!</h1>
          <p>This site is intended to give some basic tips for WvW tactics in GW2. The information is based on my experiences and observations while leveling 3 different characters almost entirely through WvW. My knowledge is by no means all inclusive nor even accurate in all situations. But hopefully you can find some useful information to make the game more enjoyable for you.</p>

          <h2>Equipment</h2>
          <p>The equipment you chose for WvW can significantly change your experience, either for the better or for the worse. People who enter WvW will find that the large scale battles, havoc groups, and even individual roamers are an entirely different challenge than what they are accustomed to compared to pve and spvp. You may have to spend some time discovering which set up works best for you. Hopefully this will give you a bit of a head start.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h2>Objectives</h2>
          <p>Objectives, whether you are taking or defending them, are a large part of WvW. Holding objectives gives your server points which ultimately determines with winner. The fight for objectives creates the opportunities for grand battles as well as to use massive siege engines like catapults, ballistas and gollems. Knowing a few tricks can give you a significant edge over your enemies.</p>

       </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h2>Open Field</h2>
          <p>Although combat in WvW often focuses around objectives combat in open field is just as fun and challenging. Fighting in open field can be very fluid, often relying more on the fighters themselves and less on siege equipment. And similar to fighting for objectives, there a many tricks you and your group can use to give you a distinct advantage.</p>
